%% General linear model
% This tutorial teaches how to use a linear systems approach to predict the 
% blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response to a stimulus. It includes instructions 
% for coding an experiment's stimulus presentation, combining the stimulus predictors 
% with a hemodynamic response function, and comparing various models to determine 
% the amount of variance in the signal that each model explains.

%% Load and inspect data 

% The tSeriesV1 vector contains fMRI data recorded from the primiary visual area (V1).
% the data was collected while a subject was viewing a set of different
% stimuli.
load('./data/tSeriesV1.mat')

% Each number corresponds to a point in time (with a time resolution of 1 second).
numMeasurement = size(data,1);
fprintf('Number of measurements: %d (seconds) \n', ...
    numMeasurement);
% The x-axis is time in seconds, and the y values are in units of percent signal change
figure;
plot(data,'LineWidth',2);
xlabel('Time (sec)');
ylabel('Signal change (%)');
%% Stimulus 
% View how the stimulus was presented:
%% 
% * The subject viewed a total of 12 textures
% * Each texture was displayed continuously for one of  1, 2, 4, 8, 15, or 30 
% seconds.
% * Each texture was presented in a random order.
% * There was a 12s baseline period after the offset of each texture.

% Stimulus timing information

% I have extracted stimulus onset and offset timings information for you:
load trialOnsetOffset.mat

% The trialOnsets vector contains the onset time of each texture in
% seconds:
trialOnsets = trialOnsetOffset(:,1);

% The trialOffsets vector contains the offset time of each image in seconds
trialOffsets = trialOnsetOffset(:,2);

% tiral duration
trialDurations = trialOffsets-trialOnsets;

% we have 12 trials in total;
numTrials = size(trialOnsets,1);

% View table of onset and offsets
% Each row indicates trial number
% For example, in trial number 3, a stimulus was presented for 4 seconds
% and the stimulus was presented 32 seconds after the start of the
% experiment and was replaced by an isoluminant gray baseline screen at
% 50 seconds after the start of the experiment
table(trialOnsets,trialOffsets,trialDurations)
% First let's create a model that considers stimulus duration.
% We'll want to preallocate a matrix of zeros to store these predictors
stimMat = zeros(numMeasurement,1);

% Loop through each of the 12 trials
for t = 1:numTrials
    % And put ones at time points when the stimulus was on
    stimMat(trialOnsets(t,1)+1:trialOffsets(t,1),1) = 1;
end

% You can get a quick sense of what stimMat looks like so far using imagesc
% Each column codes when the stimulus was on and off for a single run
% The rows (TRs) go from top (beginning of experiment) to bottom (end)

imagesc(stimMat);
colormap('gray'); xticks(''); ylabel('Time (sec)');
title('Design Matrix');
%% Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF)

% Next let's sample the SPM Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF) with a 1s
% Repeat Time
% There are multiple ways to compute the HRF in our teachmri repo, here we'll use a default 
% hrf = boyntonHIRF(1:22)
% hrf = DaleBucknerHIRF(1:22,2.25,1.25)
hrf = spm_hrf(1);
plot(hrf,'LineWidth',2); xlabel('Time (sec)'); ylabel('amplitude (a.u)');
%% Convolving stimulus timing information with HRF

% Now we can convolve the stimulus predictors for each run with this HRF
convMat = zeros(size(stimMat));
% Convolve this stimulus predictor with the HRF
convolvedStim = conv(hrf,stimMat(:,1));

% The convolved predictor extends beyond the duration of the experiment
% Store only the first 276 time points of the convolved stimulus
convMat(:,1) = convolvedStim(1:numMeasurement);

figure; imagesc(convMat); colormap('gray')
xticks(''); xlabel({'HRF convolved stimulus'}); ylabel('Time (sec)')
% Finally we'll concatenate the convolved stimulus predictors with DC
% component which captures the mean value of the signal
designMat = zeros(numMeasurement,2);
designMat(:,1) = convMat;

% Concat DC prediction
designMat(:,2) = 1;

% Now the first column in designMat indicates the stimulus and
% Columns 2, indicates the DC component of the signal.
figure; imagesc(designMat); colormap('gray');
xticks([1,2]);

%% Estimate betas and compute variance explained for Model 1

% With our model and data formatted properly we can now estimate betas
betaWeights = designMat\data;
fprintf('beta weight: %1.2f',betaWeights(1))
% The first (stimulus) predictor is assigned a beta weight of 2.88

% Now using these beta weights we can see how well our model fits the data
% Multiply the design matrix by the beta weights to generate a prediction
tSeriesPredicted = designMat*betaWeights;
% And then find the difference between this prediction and the actual data
residuals = data-tSeriesPredicted;
% Finally we can compute the proportion of variance explained by the GLM
SStotal = sum((data-mean(data)).^2);
SSerror = sum(residuals.^2);
varExp = 1-SSerror/SStotal
%% 
% This means that we're explaining 74.4 percent of the variance in V1!
% 
% How could we try to further increase the proportion of the variance explained 
% by the model?
%% Code the design matrix for Model 2
% We know that neural responses to a sustained stimulus decrease over time.
% 
% Most neurons exhibit high firing rates right after stimulus onset, but responses 
% tend to decrease with prolonged presentation of a stimulus.
% 
% The offset of a sustained stimulus can also affect neural responses, however 
% stimulus offsets can reduce responses in some neural populations.
% 
% To model these effects we will create Model 2, by adding two more predictors 
% to Model 1:

% Model 2 will have three predictors (Sustained, Onset, and Offset)
numPreds = 3;

% The row in the stimulus matrix still represents a the measurment (sec)
% But each of the three columns codes a different predictor now.
stimMat2 = zeros(numMeasurement,numPreds);

% For each of the 12 trials 
for t = 1:numTrials
    % Code when the stimulus is on vs. off in the first predictor
    stimMat2(trialOnsets(t,1)+1:trialOffsets(t,1),1) = 1;
    % Code the onset of each texture in the second predictor
    stimMat2(trialOnsets(t,1)+1,2) = 1;
    % Make sure the first predictor isn't turned on at the same time
    stimMat2(trialOnsets(t,1)+1,1) = 0;
    % Code the offset of each texture in the third predictor
    stimMat2(trialOffsets(t,1)+1,3) = 1;
end

% Have a peek at stimulus predictors for each of the three runs
figure; imagesc(stimMat2(:,:,1)); colormap('gray'); % Run 1
set(gca,'Xtick', [ 1,2,3],'XtickLabel',{'duration','onset','offset'});
ylabel('time (sec)');
% Now we can convolve stimulus predictors from each run separately
convMat2 = zeros(size(stimMat2));
% For each of the stimulus predictors (Susatined, Onset, Offset)
for p = 1:numPreds
    % Convolve this predictor with the HRF
    convolvedStim = conv(hrf,stimMat2(:,p));
    % Store only the first 276 time points of the convolved response
    convMat2(:,p) = convolvedStim(1:numMeasurement);
end

% Have a peek at convolved predictors for each of the 3 runs
figure; imagesc(convMat2(:,:,1)); colormap('gray'); % Run 1

% Finally as we did before, we'll concatenate the convolved stimulus

designMat2(:,1:numPreds) = convMat2;

% second (onset) predictor is assigned a beta weight of 8.59, and the third (offset)

% *Question 1*
% 
% Model 2 explains slightly more variance in the signal than Model 1, which 
% means that the prediction generated from Model 2 was closer to the actual data 
% than Model 1's prediction. Visually compare the fit between the measurement 
% and predictions from the two models and comment on which aspects of the predicted 
% response differ (e.g., the rise, peak, or fall).
% 
% 
% 
% *Question 2*
% 
% Fit the two GLMs again using an alternative HRF, and report how much variance 
% is explained by Model 1 and Model 2. You can do so by commenting out the default 
% HRF function in the HRF section, uncommenting one of the alternate models, and 
% rerunning the script. Be sure to report which HRF you used and the variance 
% explained by each model.
