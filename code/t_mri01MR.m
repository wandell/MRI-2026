%% Magnetic Resonance Principles
% This tutorial explains some of the basic principles of magnetic resonance 
% signals. The principles are illustrated for signals derived from a bulk substance, 
% such as a beaker of water. Various terms used to describe the MR principles 
% are introduced
%% 
% * Spins
% * Parallel/anti-parallel
% * Boltzman distribution
% * T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation), T2 (spin-spin, or transverse 
% relaxation) 
% * The concept of signal contrast is introduced. 
%% 
% The next tutorial, t_mri02Imaging, takes up the topic of how to make images 
% that measure these tissue properties in a non-uniform volume.
% 
% As the first tutorial in the series, we go slowly to give you the opportunity 
% to examine basic Matlab commands.
% 
% There are questions interspersed throughout this tutorial. Some of them will 
% be on the homework, and others are included so you can check whether you understand 
% the ideas.

%% Overview
% The protons in your body, mostly part of the water molecules, can be likened 
% to the Earth: the protons spin on an axis and have both a north and south pole. 
% Under normal circumstances, the orientation of the two poles is random. But 
% when protons are placed in an external magnetic field (when you put participants 
% into the scanner), they tend to align parallel or anti-parallel to the orientation 
% of the field. The proportion of protons aligned with the field is calculated 
% by *Boltzmann's formula*. The protons also spin (precess) around the direction 
% of the magnetic field. The precession frequency also depends on the strength 
% of the magnetic field. This is the resonant frequency, or in MR we call it the 
% *Larmor frequency*.
%% 
%% Spins resonance frequency
% When a substance is placed in a steady magnetic field, the spins (protons) 
% precess at a frequency that is characteristic of the substance. For a beaker 
% of water, the spins are hydrogen atoms.  We can compute the precession frequency 
% from the following simple formula (Note the units - see chapter 3 and ca. p. 
% 51i, 60ii for a discussion of precession). 

B0 = 1.5;     % Magnetic field strength (Tesla)
g = 42.58e+6; % Gyromagnetic constant for hydrogen (Hz / Tesla)
v = g*B0;     % The resonant (Larmor) frequency of hydrogen

% Ordinarily, the Larmor (resonant) frequency is expressed in Megahertz
% (millions of hertz)
fprintf('Hydrogen Larmor frequency\n %0.4f MHz at %.1f Tesla',...
    v/(10^6),B0);
%% *Question 1*
% What is the Larmor frequency of hydrogen in a field at 3 Tesla?

% write your code and answer here 

%% 
%% Spin Energy
% The energy in a precessing spin is proportional to its resonant frequency, 
% v (1/sec). The constant of proportionality between energy and frequency is a 
% famous constant called *Planck's constant*. (Extra credit: Find out something 
% interesting about Max Planck). Hence, the energy in a hydrogen molecule in this 
% magnetic field is:

h = 6.626e-34; % Planck's constant (Joule-sec)
E = h*v;
%% *Question 2*
% What are the units of energy (E) in this formula?
% 
% 
%% Boltzmann's formula 
% At steady state, say when the subject enters the magnet and prior to any measurements, 
% the spins (also called dipoles) align parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic 
% field. (The textbook illustrates this with a nice metaphor of gravity in Figure 
% 3.7ii, 3,6i.) 
% 
% The energy difference between the parallel and anti-parallel states is proportional 
% to the mean magnetic field. This is called the Zeeman effect (see Figure 3.8i, 
% 3.9ii in the book). 
% 
% The proportion of dipoles aligned parallel (low energy) and anti-parallel 
% (high energy) to the main field is described by the Boltzmann distribution. 
% The formula that determines the fraction of dipoles in the low and high energy 
% states is in Hornak (Chapter 2).
% 
% As the Boltzmann formula tell us (shown below), at a room temperture, there 
% are slightly more number of spins in the *lower* energy level.

k = 1.3805e-23;      % Boltzmann's constant, J/Kelvin
T = 300;             % Degrees Kelvin at room temperature
dE = h * g * B0;     % Transition energy

% Boltzmann's formula, Hornak, Chapter 3; Huettel, p. 76ii
ratioHigh2Low = exp(-dE/(k*T));

% Under typical conditions the number of dipoles in the low and high energy
% states are very similar.
fprintf('Ratio of high (anti-parallel) to low (parallel) energy state dipoles:\n  %e',ratioHigh2Low)
%% 
% At low temperatures (near absolute zero), very few of the dipoles enter the 
% high (anti-parallel) energy state. This is not important for us, but I find 
% the numbers interesting.  In fact, I can see why people might want to work on 
% low temperature physics for a while.

T = logspace(-3,2.5,50);
r = exp( -dE ./ (k*T));

%% Question 3
%% 
% * Where is human body temperature on the graph? 
% * Given human body temperature, what is the ratio of high/low energy?
% * Would the number change meaningfully if we cool the room by 10 C?

%% Net magnetization
% The MR measurements that we obtain describe the *net magnetization* in the 
% direction perpendicular to the main axis (B0 field). This direction is illustrated 
% in the following figures. 
% 
% First, here is a 3D plot that shows the net magnetization as a red circle 
% in the steady-state. The blue lines show the three axes.

% Set the azimuth and elevation of the view
AZ0 = 332.5; EL0 = 30; view(AZ0,EL0);
%% 
% The size of the MR signal we measure depends on how far the net magnetization 
% deviates from the main z-axis. We can see this deviation more easily by looking 
% at the figure straight from the top. From this view, the point is at (0,0) in 
% the (x,y) plane.

AZ1 = 0; EL1 = 90 ;  
view(AZ1,EL1)
%% 
% Notice that from this view, looking down the z-axis, we see only the x- and 
% y-axes. The net magnetization is at (0,0) so we will not see any signal. Now, 
% let's put the picture back to the 3D view.

view(AZ0,EL0);
%% 
% Suppose we excite the tissue and place the net magnetization along the x-axis 
% (90 deg RF pulse). When we look from the top now, we see that there is a large 
% magnetization component. The green point is removed from (0,0) and falls along 
% the x-axis.

% When we change the net magnetization from the steady-state position (red circle) 
% to the excited position (green circle), we are introducing a 90 deg rotation 
% in the magnetization direction. This is usually called the flip angle. This

%% 
% After receiving an excitation pulse, this component of the MR signal decays 
% gradually over time. The spin-lattice decay has been measured and, in general, 
% it follows an exponential decay rate.
% 
% Specifically, here is the rate of recovery of the T1 magnetization for hydrogen 
% molecules in gray matter.

T1 = 0.88;          % Time constant units of S
t = (0.02:0.02:6);  % Time in seconds
Mo = 1;             % Set the net magnetization in the steady state to 1 and ignore.

% This is the exponential rate of recovery of the T1 magnetization, after
% it has been set to zero by flipping the net magnetization 90 degrees.
MzG = Mo *( 1 - exp(-t ./ T1) );

% Plotted is a graph we have the magnetization of gray matter as:
plot(t,MzG,'LineWidth',3);
xlabel('Time (s)'); ylabel('longitudinal magnetization (T1)'); grid on
%% 
% The exponential time constant (recovery rates) for various brain tissues (summarized 
% by the parameter T1 above) differs both with the material and with the level 
% of the B0 field.The value T1 = 0.88 seconds above is typical of gray matter 
% at 1.5T.
% 
% The T1 value for white matter is slightly smaller. Comparing the two we see 
% that white matter recovers slightly faster (has a smaller T1):

T1 = 0.64;

%% 
% Notice that the time to recover all the way back to Mo is fairly long, on 
% the order of 3-4 sec. This is a limitation in the speed of acquisition for T1 
% imaging.
% 
% The difference in the T1 component of the signal from gray matter and white 
% matter changes over time. This difference is plotted in the next graph.

plot(t,abs(MzW - MzG),'LineWidth',3);
xlabel('Time (s)'); ylabel('Magnetization difference'); grid on
%% Question 4
% If you are seeking to make a measurement that optimizes the difference between 
% these two materials, at what time would you measure the recovery of the T1 signal? 

% write your code and answer here 

%% Tissue contrast
% Suppose you take a picture of a piece of gray paper. The whole image will 
% simply be gray, without any pattern on it. Kind of dull. If we draw with a black 
% pen on the page, however, some parts will be gray and others black. The difference 
% between the gray and black parts is called the image contrast. Because there 
% is a pattern on the page, we say the image has contrast. The pattern may contain 
% useful information.
% 
% If all the tissues in the brain had the same T1 value, then images of the 
% brain based on T1 would be no more interesting than images of the gray paper. 
% In fact, different tissue types within the brain have a range of T1 values. 
% Some regions are brighter than the gray, and some are darker. So when we measure 
% the brain, we can create a picture with contrast. Tissue contrast is an important 
% part of making a useful MR image.  
% 
% The flexibility of MR methods allows us to create many types of contrast - 
% as if drawings on the paper were made with a variety of colored pens. Each type 
% of contrast can potentially reveal different types of information.
% 
% Different types of brain tissue have different T1 values. This enables us 
% to make useful pictures (with contrast) of the brain. But remember the T1 value 
% is a time constant. So having different T1 values means that the signals we 
% obtain vary over time. How do we create these images from the time-varying signal?
% 
% We can visualize this difference as follows. Suppose that we have two beakers, 
% adjacent to one another, containing materials with different T1 values. Suppose 
% we make a pair of images in which the intensity of each image is set to the 
% T1 value over time. What would the T1 images look like? 
% 
% The beakers start with the same, Mo, magnetization.

beaker1 = Mo*ones(32,32);
beaker2 = Mo*ones(32,32);

% They will have different T1 relaxation values
T1(1) = 0.64;       % T1 for white matter
T1(2) = 0.88;       % T1 for gray matter
mrvNewGraphWin;
movieT = (0.001:.1:4);   % We sample the movie at these times (in sec)
%% Question 5
% Look up the T1 value of cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF). Plot the T1 recovery of 
% CSF. At what time you would measure to maximize the white/CSF contrast.

% write your code and answer here 

%% 
% Here is a movie, slowed down, showing the relative intensities of the images 
% over a 4 sec period, sampled every 100 ms. The frames are shown at 1/4 the real 
% speed (i.e., every 100 ms). As you can see, if we make a picture of the net 
% magnetization around 0.6-1.0 sec during the decay, there will be a good contrast 
% difference between the gray and white matter. Measured earlier or later, the 
% picture will have less contrast.
% 
% *Note: Movies don't play well inside this Live Code ... they should appear 
% in an external window.*

%% Question 6
% Instead of plotting the difference, plot the ratio of the levels, MzW and 
% MzG. 
%% 
% * When is the ratio the biggest?
% * Why would we measure at a time when the difference, rather than ratio is 
% biggest?

%% T2 signals
% There is a second physical mechanism, in addition to the spin-lattice measurement, 
% that influences the MR signal. This second mechanism is called spin-spin interaction 
% (transverse relaxation). This signaling mechanism is particularly important 
% for functional magnetic resonance imaging and the BOLD signal.
% 
% In describing the T1 signal, we treated the MR signal as a single unified 
% vector. In the example above, we explored what happens to the net magnetization 
% of the MR signal when the vector is rotated 90 deg into the x-y plane.
% 
% But we omitted any discussion the fact that the dipoles are assumed to be 
% continuously precessing around the main axis together, in unison. Perhaps in 
% a perfectly homogeneous environment, these rotating dipoles would precess at 
% the Larmor frequency in perfect synchronization and we could treat the single 
% large vector as we have.
% 
% But in practice, the dipoles within a single voxel of a functional image each 
% experience slightly different magnetic field environments. Consequently, they 
% each have their own individual Larmor frequencies, proportional to the magnetic 
% field that they experience. An important second mechanism of MR is a consequence 
% of the fact that the individual dipoles each have their own local magnetic field 
% and the synchrony soon dissipate.
% 
% Suppose we have a large sample of dipoles that are spinning together in perfect 
% phase. We can specify their orientation as an angle in this plane, theta. Let's 
% assume they all share a common angle.

nSamples = 10000;
theta = zeros(nSamples,1);

% Then the position of the spins in the (x,y) plane will be
spins = [cos(theta), sin(theta)];

% And they will all fall at the same poisiton

netMagnetization = sqrt(averagePosition(1)^2 + averagePosition(2)^2);
fprintf('Net magnetization %f\n',netMagnetization);
%% 
% Now, suppose that spins are precessing at slightly different rates. So after 
% a few moments in time they do not fall at exactly the same angle. We can express 
% this by creating a new vector theta that has some variability.
